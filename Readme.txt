<!-- Members of Stjarnor

Please create a new folder named the language you are using if there is not one already (e.g. Python)
Once in there, create another folder with your preferred name/nickname (e.g. Harry)
Put your code in this folder. It is highly recommended you add a readme to each project.

When you have put information from a folder, anyone is allowed to use it with the Creative Commons License 1.0. This license basically says:
Anyone can use your code elsewhere, as long as they credit you. The person is also allowed to earn money from the code, as long as correct credit is given in
an obvious place.

Tell me on Discord if you wish more information to be added to the Readme.txt, or want to know more about the project (Gee#8751) -->
