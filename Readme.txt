<!-- Members of Stjarnor

Please create a new branch named the language you are using if there is not one already (e.g. Python)
Once in there, name your file with your preferred name/nickname, the project name, then the version. (e.g. HarryRpiConnectivity-1.0.py)
Put your code in this file. It is highly recommended you add a readme to each project, name with a -README at the end. (e.g. HarryRpiConnectivity-1.0-README.py)
In the main branch, all the files uploaded will be there. When you upload files, create a Draft Pull Request so others can look at the code before it is moved to main.
All the files will be moved to your branch (e.g. Python) once the pull request has been accepted, but I can check which files were directly added to a branch.
If you need help with anything to do with Github message me on Discord (Gee#8751)
