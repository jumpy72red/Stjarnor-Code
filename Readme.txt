<!-- Members of Stjarnor

Please create a new branch named the language you are using if there is not one already (e.g. Python)
Once in there, name your file with your preferred name/nickname, the project name, then the version. (e.g. HarryRpiConnectivity-1.0.py)
Put your code in this file. It is highly recommended you add a readme to each project, name with a -README at the end. (e.g. HarryRpiConnectivity-1.0-README.py)

When you have put information onto this repository, anyone is allowed to use it with the Creative Commons License 1.0. This license basically says:
Anyone can use your code elsewhere, as long as they credit you. The person is also allowed to earn money from the code, as long as correct credit is given in an obvious place.

Tell me on Discord if you wish more information to be added to the Readme.txt, or want to know more about the project (Gee#8751) -->
