# Stjarnor Code

## Rules

- Creat a branch for each language used if it does not allready exist
- When creating a file use this system:
  - Name of file
  - Project name
  - Version
  - add -README to the end
  - e.g. HarryRpiConnectivity-1.0-README
- If you are directaly uploding code to the main branch, use draft pull so that other can reavie befor it tis uploded
- All files will be moved to the branch specific to your projects language (will still be available on the main branch)
