# Stjärnor Code

## Rules

- Create a branch for each language used if it does not already exist
- When creating a file use this system:.
  - Your preferred name.
  - Project name.
  - Version.
  - Readme file required with code file, add -README to the end.
  - e.g. HarryRpiConnectivity-1.0-README
- If you are directly uploading code to the main branch, use draft pull so that others can review before it is uploaded
- All files will be moved to the branch specific to your projects language, but will all be available on the main branch

### CodeQL Info
**CodeQL will present failed tests until code for C#, Java & Python are added. Until then, it will show errors. I will probably add some simple
documents for each of these, to prevent the errors.**
